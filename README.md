# machine_learning_crypto

The purpose of this project is to use Python and unsupervised machine learning to analyze data on different cryptocurrencies. They are classified based on features such as total supply and the algorithms they use. The entire process can be summarized in four steps: 

- Data preprocessing
- Using Principal Component Analysis to reduce the data dimensions 
- Using K-means to cluster
- Visualizing the results using hvPlot
